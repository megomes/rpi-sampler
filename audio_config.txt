# Raspberry Pi MIDI Sampler - JACK Audio Configuration
# Edit this file to configure the audio engine
# Restart the sampler after modifying to apply changes

# NOTE: With JACK, sample rate and buffer size are defined by the JACK daemon
# This sampler uses 48kHz professional standard
# Command: jackd -dalsa -dhw:0 -r48000 -p1024 -n2

# MASTER GAIN
# Overall sampler volume (0.1 to 1.0)
# Lower values prevent clipping but reduce volume
# 
# 0.5 = medium volume, safe for multiple voices
# 0.7 = high volume, may clip with many voices
# 1.0 = maximum volume, risk of distortion
#
# Possible values: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0
master_gain=0.7

# MAX VOICES
# Maximum number of samples playing simultaneously
# More voices = more polyphony, more CPU
#
# 4 = basic, for older Pi
# 8 = standard, good polyphony
# 16 = maximum, for Pi 4 or higher
#
# Possible values: 2, 4, 8, 16
max_voices=8

# AUTO GAIN CONTROL
# Automatically reduces volume when many voices play together
# Prevents distortion in large chords
#
# 1 = enabled (recommended)
# 0 = disabled (fixed volume)
#
# Possible values: 0, 1
auto_gain_control=1

# JACK CLIENT NAME
# JACK client name (appears in connections)
# Use unique names if running multiple instances
#
# Default: "rpi-sampler"
jack_client_name=rpi-sampler

# AUTO CONNECT
# Automatically connects to system outputs
# 1 = auto-connect (recommended)
# 0 = manual connection required
#
# Possible values: 0, 1
auto_connect=1

# OUTPUT CHANNELS
# Number of output channels
# 1 = mono, 2 = stereo
#
# Possible values: 1, 2
output_channels=2
